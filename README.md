The Stefan problem is common throughout physics and applied mathematics. It is the solution to heat transfer at a phase boundary. This repository is a collection of work that I did on the Stefan problem for an independent study while at the University of Montana. My indepependent study followed along with the lectures from Gilbert Strang at MITopencourseware and used this as a project to develop some of my numerical skills. I assess four different numerical methods for solving the Stefan problem:

- Analytical Solution

- Variable Space Grid

- Enthalpy Method

- Level Set Method
