abstract = {The growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial cycles.},

abstract = {Polythermal conditions are ubiquitous among glaciers, from small valley glaciers to ice sheets. Conventional temperature-based 'cold-ice' models of such ice masses cannot account for that portion of the internal energy which is latent heat of liquid water within temperate ice, so such schemes are not energy-conserving when temperate ice is present. Temperature and liquid water fraction are, however, functions of a single enthalpy variable: a small enthalpy change in cold ice is a change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change in temperate ice is a change in liquid water fraction. The unified enthalpy formulation described here models the mass and energy balance for the three-dimensional ice fluid, for the surface runoff layer and for the subglacial hydrology layer, together in a single energy-conserving theoretical framework. It is implemented in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Results for the Greenland ice sheet are compared with those from a cold-ice scheme. This paper is intended to be an accessible foundation for enthalpy formulations in glaciology.},

abstract = {Calving of icebergs is an important component of mass loss from the polar ice sheets and glaciers in many parts of the world. Calving rates can increase dramatically in response to increases in velocity and/or retreat of the glacier margin, with important implications for sea level change. Despite their importance, calving and related dynamic processes are poorly represented in the current generation of ice sheet models. This is largely because understanding the 'calving problem' involves several other long-standing problems in glaciology, combined with the difficulties and dangers of field data collection. In this paper, we systematically review different aspects of the calving problem, and outline a new framework for representing calving processes in ice sheet models. We define a hierarchy of calving processes, to distinguish those that exert a fundamental control on the position of the ice margin from more localised processes responsible for individual calving events. The first-order control on calving is the strain rate arising from spatial variations in velocity (particularly sliding speed), which determines the location and depth of surface crevasses. Superimposed on this first-order process are second-order processes that can further erode the ice margin. These include: fracture propagation in response to local stress imbalances in the immediate vicinity of the glacier front; undercutting of the glacier terminus by melting at or below the waterline; and bending at the junction between grounded and buoyant parts of an ice tongue. Calving of projecting, submerged 'ice feet' can be regarded as a third-order process, because it is paced by first-or second-order calving above the waterline. First-order calving can be represented in glacier models using a calving criterion based on crevasse depth, which is a function of longitudinal strain rate. Modelling changes in terminus position and calving rates thus reduces to the problem of determining the ice geometry and velocity distribution. Realistic solutions to the problem of modelling ice flow therefore depend critically on an appropriate choice of sliding law. Models that assume that basal velocities are controlled by basal drag can replicate much of the observed behaviour of calving glaciers with grounded termini, but an important limitation is that they cannot be used to model floating glacier termini or ice shelves. Alternative sliding laws that parameterise drag from the glacier margins provide more flexible and robust ways of representing calving in ice sheet models. Such models can explain a remarkable range of observed phenomena within a simple, unifying framework, including: downglacier increases in velocity and strain rates where basal and/or lateral drag diminishes; flow acceleration in response to thinning through time; the tendency for glaciers to stabilise at 'pinning points' in relatively shallow water or fjord narrowings; the constraints on ice shelf stability; and the contrasts in calving rates between tidewater and freshwater calving glaciers. Many unresolved issues remain, however, including the role played by the removal of backstress in the acceleration of retreating calving glaciers, and the controls on melting at and below the waterline.},

abstract = {Landslide inventory maps are necessary for assessing landslide hazards and addressing the role slope stability plays in landscape evolution over geologic timescales. However, landslide inventory maps produced with traditional methods - aerial photograph interpretation, topographic map analysis, and field inspection - are often subjective and incomplete. The increasing availability of high-resolution topographic data acquired via airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) over broad swaths of terrain invites new, automated landslide mapping procedures. We present two methods of spectral analysis that utilize LiDAR-derived digital elevation models of the Puget Sound lowlands, Washington, and the Tualatin Mountains, Oregon, to quantify and automatically map the topographic signatures of deep-seated landslides. Power spectra produced using the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform and the two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform identify the characteristic spatial frequencies of deep-seated landslide morphologic features such as hummocky topography, scarps, and displaced blocks of material. Spatial patterns in the amount of spectral power concentrated in these characteristic frequency bands highlight past slope instabilities and allow the delineation of landslide terrain. When calibrated by comparison with detailed, independently compiled landslide inventory maps, our algorithms correctly classify an average of 82{\%} of the terrain in our five study areas. Spectral analysis also allows the creation of dominant wavelength maps, which prove useful in analyzing meter-scale topographic expressions of landslide mechanics, past landslide activity, and landslide-modifying geomorphic processes. These results suggest that our automated landslide mapping methods can create accurate landslide maps and serve as effective, objective, and efficient tools for digital terrain analysis. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {[1] A surface mass balance model aimed at being coupled to a Global Circulation Model (GCM) for future climate prediction is described and tested for the Greenland Ice Sheet. The model builds on previous modeling designed to be forced by automatic weather station data, and includes surface energy balance as well as processes occurring near the surface such as water percolation and refreezing. Surface albedo is calculated with a new scheme that differentiates the timescale for aging of wet and dry snow and incorporates the effect of a thin layer of water and/or fresh snow at the surface. The model was driven with automatic weather station data from two sites located in the ablation zone in the Kangerlussuaq area ( West Greenland), and calculated reasonable annual mass balance values ( within 10{\%} in seven out of eight cases) for four individual and consecutive years ( 1998 - 2001), using both measured and calculated albedo. This implies that the albedo parameterization is adequate and climate feedbacks affecting the mass balance are well captured. The model was then applied to a distributed 20-km-resolution grid covering the whole ice sheet, and forced with 10 years of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-40) data. With the aim of coupling the model to a GCM, this study focuses on the ability to model the interannual variability in mass balance rather than to assess the present state of balance of the ice sheet. Modeled spatial and temporal wet zone extent compares well with information derived from passive microwave satellite data.},

abstract = {Temporal and spatial variability are analysed in Greenland instrumental temperature records from 24 coastal and three ice sheet locations. Trends over the longest period available, 1873–2001, at Ilulissat/Jakobshavn indicate statistically significant warming in all seasons: 5 °C in winter. Trends over the 1901–2000 century in southern Greenland indicate statistically significant spring and summer cooling. General periods of warming occurred from 1885 to 1947 and 1984 to 2001, and cooling occurred from 1955 to 1984. The standard period 1961–90 was marked by 1–2 °C statistically significant cooling. In contrast to Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, the 1990s do not contain the warmest years on record in Greenland. The warmest years in Greenland were 1932, 1947, 1960, and 1941. The coldest years were 1918, 1984, 1993, and 1972, several of which coincide with major volcanic eruptions. Over 1991–2000, statistically significant 2–4°C warming was observed in western Greenland, 1.1 °C warming at the ice sheet summit (3200 m), although this is statistically insignificant. Annual temperature trends are dominated by winter variability.Much of the observed variability is shown to be linked with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), sea ice extent, and volcanism. The correlation of coastal temperature anomalies with the NAO is statistically significant, in autumn and winter at western and southern sites. Warming from 1873 to 1930 and subsequent cooling persists after the removal of the NAO signal. Temperature trends are often opposite between west and east Greenland. This apparent teleconnection is spurious, however, given insignificant east–west correlation values. Frequency peaks correspond with periods of 3.7, 14.3, 9.1, 5.5–6.0, 11.1, and 7.1 years in both temperature and NAO.},

abstract = {A full-stress, thermomechanically coupled, numerical model is used to explore the interaction between basal thermal conditions and motion of a terrestrially terminating section of the west Greenland ice sheet. The model domain is a two-dimensional flowline profile extending from the ice divide to the margin. We use data-assimilation techniques based on the adjoint model in order to optimize the basal traction field, minimizing the difference between modeled and observed surface velocities. We monitor the sensitivity of the frozen/melted boundary (FMB) to changes in prescribed geothermal heat flux and sliding speed by applying perturbations to each of these parameters. The FMB shows sensitivity to the prescribed geothermal heat flux below an upper threshold where a maximum portion of the bed is already melted. The position of the FMB is insensitive to perturbations applied to the basal traction field. This insensitivity is due to the short distances over which longitudinal stresses act in an ice sheet.},

abstract = {Greater understanding of variations in firn densification is needed to distinguish between dynamic and melt-driven elevation changes on the Greenland ice sheet. This is especially true in Greenland's percolation zone, where firn density profiles are poorly documented because few ice cores are extracted in regions with surface melt. We used georadar to investigate firn density variations with depth along a {\&}8764;70 km transect through a portion of the accumulation area in western Greenland that partially melts. We estimated electromagnetic wave velocity by inverting reflection traveltimes picked from common midpoint gathers. We followed a procedure designed to find the simplest velocity versus depth model that describes the data within estimated uncertainty. On the basis of the velocities, we estimated 13 depth-density profiles of the upper 80 m using a petrophysical model based on the complex refractive index method equation. At the highest elevation site, our density profile is consistent with nearby core data acquired in the same year. Our profiles at the six highest elevation sites match an empirically based densification model for dry firn, indicating relatively minor amounts of water infiltration and densification by melt and refreeze in this higher region of the percolation zone. At the four lowest elevation sites our profiles reach ice densities at substantially shallower depths, implying considerable meltwater infiltration and ice layer development in this lower region of the percolation zone. The separation between these two regions is 8 km and spans 60 m of elevation, which suggests that the balance between dry-firn and melt-induced densification processes is sensitive to minor changes in melt.},

abstract = {Predicting how climate change will affect glacier and ice sheet flow speeds remains a large hurdle toward accurate sea level rise forecasting. Increases in surface melt rates are known to accelerate glacier flow in summer, whereas in winter, flow speeds are believed to be relatively invariant. Here we show that wintertime flow speeds on nearly all major glaciers throughout Alaska are not only variable but are inversely related to melt from preceding summers. For each additional meter of summertime melt, we observe an 11{\%} decrease in wintertime velocity on glaciers of all sizes, geometries, climates, and bed types. This dynamic occurs because interannual differences in summertime melt affect how much water is retained in the subglacial system during winter. The ubiquity of the dynamic indicates it occurs globally on glaciers and ice sheets not frozen to their beds and thus constitutes a new mechanism affecting sea level rise projections.},

abstract = {Crevasse initiation is linked to strain rates that range over three orders of magnitude (0.001 and 0.163 a –1) as a result of the temperature-dependent nonlinear rheological properties of ice and from water and debris inclusions. Here we discuss a small cold glacier that contains buried crevasses at and near an ice divide. Surface-conformable stratigraphy, the glacier's small size, and cold temperatures argue for limited rheological variability at this site. Surface ice-flow velocities of (1.2–15.5) ⌃ 0.472 m a –1 imply classic saddle flow surrounding the ice divide. Numerical models that incorporate field-observed boundary conditions suggest extensional strain rates of 0.003–0.015 a –1 , which fall within the published estimates required for crevasse initiation. The occurrence of one crevasse beginning at 50 m depth that appears to penetrate close to the bed suggests that it formed at depth. Field data and numerical models indicate that a higher interior stress at this crevasse location may be associated with steep convex bed topography; however, the dynamics that caused its formation are not entirely clear.},

abstract = {Rapid, local drainage of surface meltwater to the base of the Greenland ice sheet is thought to result in surface velocity variations as far inland as the equilibrium zone (Zwally and others, 2002). Ice-penetrating radar surveys throughout this region allow us to characterize englacial drainage features that appear as vertically stacked diffraction hyperbolae in common-offset profiles. These data are used with a radar-simulation model, which allows for variations in geometry, penetration depth and infill material, to understand the characteristics of these hyperbolae and the likelihood that they are produced by moulins. We find only a moderate correlation between the locations of these possible moulins and supraglacial lakes, indicating that many lakes drain over the surface of the ice sheet, or do not contain sufficient water to reach the bed through moulin formation. We find a strong correlation between moulin location in the ablation region and elevated along-flow tension (due to flow over rough bedrock), which generates surface crevassing and provides an entry point for meltwater. Although theory suggests that moulins may form anywhere on the ice sheet given sufficient meltwater input, our data suggest that they are far more common in the ablation zone than near, or inland from, the equilibrium line.},

abstract = {Creep instability, the runaway increase of internal temperature and deformation rate, may affect the boundary condition at the base of glaciers and ice sheets and thus influence their flow and dimensions. We consider a simple slab model of heat transport in which three dimensionless parameters determine the relative importance of strain heating, ice advection normal to the surface, and boundary conditions. We find that an ice mass will be unstable if the strain-heating parameter exceeds a critical value which depends strongly on advection and boundary conditions. Critical values over the range of parameters appropriate to natural ice masses are presented. Accumulation (downward advection) or ablation (upward advection) affects the critical value by up to 5 orders of magnitude: ablation tends to reduce stability, and accumulation increases it. For an ice mass frozen to its bed, instability eventually raises the basal ice to melting point. This can restore thermal stability, but the ice mass will start to slide over its bed. If the strain-heating parameter exceeds a second, higher critical value, a layer of basal ice at melting point will form. We find that the conditions for instability are likely to exist in the accumulation and ablation zones of certain glaciers and ice sheets. However, times calculated for instability to develop are in the range 102{\&}{\#}8211;103 yr for glaciers and 103{\&}{\#}8211;104 yr for ice sheets. As these times exceed the normal residence time for ice in the ablation zone, it appears that instability is most likely to develop in the accumulation zone. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that ablation increases the growth time for instability, whereas accumulation decreases it. The growth times quoted above are longer than the periods of most glacier surges, and thus creep instability is an unlikely surge mechanism. Unstable conditions may, however, obtain in East Antarctica and may have existed in the central part of ice age ice sheets. Surges of ice sheets triggered by creep instability may be possible.},

The variety and complexity of these processes, which involve interactions among ice, water, and geological solids, resist efforts to establish simple truths and can lead to surprising outcomes. Thermal conditions at the ice-bed interface (melting or nonmelting) and the mechanical properties of the glacier substrate (soft or hard) determine which processes can be activated. The warm-soft case supports the greatest variety of processes and is the most important for fast-flow dynamics and for the mobilization of subglacial sediment.

abstract = {We present a new record of ice thickness change, reconstructed at nearly 100,000 sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from laser altimetry measurements spanning the period 1993-2012, partitioned into changes due to surface mass balance (SMB) and ice dynamics. We estimate a mean annual GrIS mass loss of 243 ± 18 Gt ⋅ y(-1), equivalent to 0.68 mm ⋅ y(-1) sea level rise (SLR) for 2003-2009. Dynamic thinning contributed 48{\%}, with the largest rates occurring in 2004-2006, followed by a gradual decrease balanced by accelerating SMB loss. The spatial pattern of dynamic mass loss changed over this time as dynamic thinning rapidly decreased in southeast Greenland but slowly increased in the southwest, north, and northeast regions. Most outlet glaciers have been thinning during the last two decades, interrupted by episodes of decreasing thinning or even thickening. Dynamics of the major outlet glaciers dominated the mass loss from larger drainage basins, and simultaneous changes over distances up to 500 km are detected, indicating climate control. However, the intricate spatiotemporal pattern of dynamic thickness change suggests that, regardless of the forcing responsible for initial glacier acceleration and thinning, the response of individual glaciers is modulated by local conditions. Recent projections of dynamic contributions from the entire GrIS to SLR have been based on the extrapolation of four major outlet glaciers. Considering the observed complexity, we question how well these four glaciers represent all of Greenland's outlet glaciers.},

abstract = {We review the major subglacial till forming processes as presently understood by glacial researchers and define the parameters within which tills are produced and reconcile them with sedimentary end members. Processes of deformation, flow, sliding, lodgement and ploughing coexist at the base of temperate glacier ice and act to mobilize and transport sediment and deposit it as various end members, ranging from glacitectonically folded and faulted stratified material to texturally homogeneous diamicton. The dominance of any one subglacial process varies both spatially and temporally, giving rise to the possibility that a till or complex till sequence contains a superimposed signature of former transportation/deposition at the ice-bed interface. We recommend that, while glacial geologists and geomorphologists should be able to recognize the sedimentary imprints of various subglacial processes, genetic fingerprinting of subglacial tills should be less process-specific and till classification must reflect the range of products encompassed by the subglacial till production continuum. Glacial geologists can presently unequivocally identify: a) glacitectonite (rock or sediment that has been deformed by subglacial shearing/deformation but retains some of the structural characteristics of the parent material); b) subglacial traction till (sediment deposited by a glacier sole either sliding over and/or deforming its bed, the sediment having been released directly from the ice by pressure melting and/or liberated from the substrate and then disaggregated and completely or largely homogenised by shearing); and support the theoretical case for c) melt-out till (sediment released by the melting of stagnant or slowly moving debris-rich glacier ice, and directly deposited without subsequent transport or deformation). Because observations on contemporary glaciers reveal that their beds are most likely to be mosaics of deformation and sliding and warm based and cold based conditions, the patterns of which change temporally and spatially, it is extremely unlikely that subglacial till end members in the geological record will be anything but hybrids produced by the range of processes operative in the subglacial traction zone. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The temperature parameterization is compared to a previous study and is shown to be in better agreement with observations. The temperature parameterization is tested in a positive degree-day model to simulate the present (19962006) mean melt area extent of the GrIS. The model accounts for firn warming, rainfall and refreezing of meltwater, with different degree-day factors for ice and snow under warm and cold climate conditions.

abstract = {Abstract. We report future projections of Surface Mass Balance (SMB) over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) obtained with the regional climate model MAR, forced by the outputs of three CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) when considering two different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The GCMs selected in this study have been chosen according to their ability to simulate the current climate over Greenland. Our results indicate that in a warmer climate (i) the mass gained due to increased precipitation over GrIS does not compensate the mass lost through increased run-off; (ii) the surface melt increases non-linearly with rising temperatures due to the positive feedback between surface albedo and melt, associated with the expansion of bare ice zones which, in addition, decreases the ice sheet refreezing capacity; (iii) most of the precipitation is expected to fall as rainfall in summer, which further increases surface melt; (iv) no considerable change is expected on the length of the melting season, since heavier winter snowfall dampens the melt increase at the end of spring; (v) the increase of meltwater run-off versus temperature anomalies is dependent of the GCM-forced MAR ability to simulate the current climate; (vi) the MAR-simulated SMB changes can be approximated using the annual accumulated snowfall and summer 600 hPa temperature increase simulated by the forcing GCMs. In view of the large range in the CMIP5 future projections for the same future scenario, the GCM-based SMB approximations allow us to estimate what future projections are most likely within the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. In 2100, the ensemble mean projects a sea level rise, resulting from a GrIS SMB decrease, estimated to be +4 ± 2 cm and +9 ± 4 cm for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The GrIS SMB should remain positive with respect to RCP 4.5 scenario and becomes negative around 2070 in the case of the RCP 8.5 scenario since a global warming {\textgreater}+3 °C is needed. However, these future projections do not consider the positive melt-elevation feedback because the ice sheet topography is fixed through the whole simulation. In this regard, the MAR simulations suggest a cumulative ice sheet thinning by 2100 of {\~{}}100–200 m in the ablation zone. This highlights the importance of coupling climate models to an ice sheet model to consider the future response of both surface processes and ice-dynamic changes, and their mutual feedbacks to rising temperatures.},

abstract = {Understanding the flow of water through the body of a glacier is important, because the spatial distribution of water and the rate of infiltration to the glacier bottom is one control on water storage and pressure, glacier sliding and surging, and the release of glacial outburst floods. According to the prevailing hypothesis, this water flow takes place in a network of tubular conduits. Here we analyse video images from 48 boreholes drilled into the small Swedish glacier Storglaci{\"{a}}ren, showing that the glacier's hydrological system is instead dominated by fractures that convey water at slow speeds. We detected hydraulically connected fractures at all depths, including near the glacier bottom. Our observations indicate that fractures provide the main pathways for surface water to reach deep within the glacier, whereas tubular conduits probably form only in special circumstances. A network of hydraulically linked fractures offers a simple explanation for the origin and evolution of the englacial water flow system and its seasonal regeneration. Such a fracture network also explains radar observations that reveal a complex pattern of echoes rather than a system of conduits. Our findings may be important in understanding the catastrophic collapse of ice shelves and rapid hydraulic connection between the surface and bed of an ice sheet.},

abstract = {Understanding the flow of water through the body of a glacier is important, because the spatial distribution of water and the rate of infiltration to the glacier bottom is one control on water storage and pressure, glacier sliding and surging, and the release of glacial outburst floods. According to the prevailing hypothesis, this water flow takes place in a network of tubular conduits. Here we analyse video images from 48 boreholes drilled into the small Swedish glacier Storglaci{\"{a}}ren, showing that the glacier's hydrological system is instead dominated by fractures that convey water at slow speeds. We detected hydraulically connected fractures at all depths, including near the glacier bottom. Our observations indicate that fractures provide the main pathways for surface water to reach deep within the glacier, whereas tubular conduits probably form only in special circumstances. A network of hydraulically linked fractures offers a simple explanation for the origin and evolution of the englacial water flow system and its seasonal regeneration. Such a fracture network also explains radar observations that reveal a complex pattern of echoes rather than a system of conduits. Our findings may be important in understanding the catastrophic collapse of ice shelves and rapid hydraulic connection between the surface and bed of an ice sheet.},

abstract = {Understanding water movement through a glacier is fundamental to several critical issues in glaciology, including glacier dynamics, glacier-induced floods, and the prediction of runoff from glacierized drainage basins. To this end we have synthesized a conceptual model of water movement through a temperate glacier from the surface to the outlet stream. Processes that regulate the rate and distribution of water input at the glacier surface and that regulate water movement from the surface to the bed play important but commonly neglected roles in glacier hydrology. Where a glacier is covered by a layer of porous, permeable firn (the accumulation zone), the flux of water to the glacier interior varies slowly because the firn temporarily stores water and thereby smooths out variations in the supply rate. In the firn-free ablation zone, in contrast, the flux of water into the glacier depends directly on the rate of surface melt or rainfall and therefore varies greatly in time. Water moves from the surfae to the bed through an upward branching arborescent network consisting of both steeply inclined conduits, formed by the enlargement of intergranular veins, and gently inclined conduits, spawed by water flow along the bottoms of near-surface fractures (crevasses). Englacial drainage conduits deliver water to the glacier bed at a limited number of points, probably a long distance downglacier of where water enters the glacier. Englacial conduits supplied from the accumulation zone are quasi steady state features that convey the slowly varying water flux delivered via the firn. Their size adjusts so that they are usually full of water and flow is pressurized. In contrast, water flow in englacial conduits supplied from the ablation area is pressurized only near times of peak daily flow or during rainstorms; flow is otherwise in an open-channel configuration. The subglacial drainage system typically consists of several elements that are distinct both morphologically and hydrologically. An upglacier branching, arborescent network of channels incised into the basal ice conveys water rapidly. Much of the water flux to the bed probably enters directly into the arborescent channel network, which covers only a small fraction of the glacier bed. More extensive spatially is a nonarborescent network, which commonly includes cavities (gaps between the glacier sole and bed), channels incised into the bed, and a layer of permeable sediment. The nonarborescent network conveys water sloly and is usually poorly connected to the arborescent system. The arborescent channel network largely collapses during the winter but reforms in the spring as the first flush of meltwater to the bed destabilizes the cavities within the nonarborescent network. The volume of water stored by a glacier varies diurnally and seasonally. Small, temperate alpine glaciers seem to attain a maximum seasonal water storage of {\~{}}200mm of water averaged over the area of the glacier bed, with daily fluctuations of as much as 20-30mm. The likely storage capacity of subglacial cavities is insufficient to account for estimated stored water volumes, so most water storage may actually occur englacially. Stored water may also be released abruptly and catastrophically in the form of outburst floods.},

abstract = {Frost cracking, the breakdown of rock by freezing, is one of the most important mechanical weathering processes acting on Earth's surface. Insights on the mechanisms driving frost cracking stem mainly from laboratory and theoretical studies. Transferring insights from such studies to natural conditions, involving jointed bedrock and heterogeneous thermal and hydrological properties, is a major challenge. We address this problem with simultaneous in situ measurements of acoustic emissions, used as proxy of rock damage, and rock temperature/moisture content. The 1 year data set acquired in an Alpine rock wall shows that (1) liquid water content has an important impact on freezing-induced rock damage, (2) sustained freezing can yield much stronger damage than repeated freeze-thaw cycling, and (3) that frost cracking occurs over the full range of temperatures measured extending from 0 down to −15°C. These new measurements yield a slightly different picture than previous field studies where ice segregation appears to play an important role.},

abstract = {In the present work, a numerical model that calculates the surface energy balance, mass balance and temperature in the uppermost 25 m of ice at a single location on a glacier is presented. The model is forced by five "basic" meteorological elements: air temperature and humidity, wind speed, cloud amount and precipitation. The model was developed for studies of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Parameterizations of the surface energy fluxes were optimised with data mainly from the ETH Camp, West Greenland (1155 m a.s.1.). The model was tested on data collected during the summer of 1990 in the ETH Camp. In this case measurements of the radiative fluxes could be used. A reasonable fit between measurements and calculations of mass balance and englacial temperature could be obtained. The energy balance of this summer is discussed. Irr a second application, the annual cycle of the energy and mass balance and the englacial temperature at the location of the ETH Camp was simulated. In this case long term average values of the input variables were estimated from measurements at other locations and the radiative fluxes were computed with the parameterizations. The effect of model uncertainties on the calculated mass balance and 10 m ice temperature is discussed. The energy balance and the relation between air and ice temperature are analysed. The uncertainty in the calculated ablation is so large (500-1000 mm w.e./yr) that the contribution of ablation on the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level rise cannot be calculated with sufficient accuracy (i.e. 60 mm w.e./yr) with this kind of model. However, the model should be appropriate for the determination of the sensitivity of ablation to climate change. It is predicted that at the ETH Camp the mass balance will decrease by 610 mm w.e./yr after a temperature increase of I°C.},

abstract = {Measurements of the deformation of a dense array of boreholes in Worthington Glacier, Alaska, show that the glacier moves with generally bed-parallel motion. Strain in the 200m deep valley glacier is constant near the surface but follows a nonlinear vertical profile below a depth of about 120m. By a depth of 180m, the octahedral strain rate reaches 0.35yr{\^{}}-1. The three-dimensional velocity field shows spatial complexity with significant deviations from plane strain, despite relatively simple valley geometry in the vicinity of the 6x10{\^{}}6 m{\^{}}3 study volume. No evidence was found for time-varying deformation or movement along localized shear planes. Observations were made by repeatedly measuring the long-axis geometry of 31 closely spaced boreholes over a 70 day period, and three additional holes after 1 full year of deformation. The holes were spaced15 to 30 m apart. Installation and measurement of such a large number of boreholes required the development of a semiautomated hotwater drilling system that creates straight and vertical boreholes with uniform walls. The equipment and procedures enables borehole profiles to be measured without the use of hole casing. Inclinometry measurements collected in the holes were processed, analyzed for error,and visualized as a fully three-dimensional dataset. The new methods offer unique insight into small-scale spatial and temporal variations in the pattern of flow in a valley glacier.},

Sliding at the bed accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the glacier's surface motion. Strain rates in the ice were low from the surface to a depth of about 120 meters, but then increased rapidly toward the bed. Ice deformation was not affected by temporal changes in the sliding rate.

abstract = {Application of the energy balance approach to estimate snowmelt inherently presumes that the external energy fluxes can be measured or modeled with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate the internal energy changes and melt rate. However, owing to difficulties in directly measuring the internal energy content of the snow during melt periods, the ability to close the energy balance is rarely quantified. To address this, all of the external energy balance terms (sensible and latent heat fluxes, shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes, and the ground heat flux) were directly measured and compared to changes of the energy content within an extensive, homogeneous, snowpack of a level field near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The snow was observed to lose significant amounts of energy because of a persistent longwave radiation imbalance caused by low incoming fluxes during cold, clear-sky periods, while solar heating of the snow surface caused an increase in the outgoing fluxes. The sum of the measured turbulent heat fluxes, ground heat flux, and solar radiation fluxes were insufficient to offset these losses, however the snowpack temperatures were not observed to cool. It was concluded that an unmeasured exchange of sensible heat was occurring from the atmosphere to the snowpack. The exchange mechanism for this is not known but would appear to be consistent with the concept of a windless exchange as employed to close the energy balance in various snow models. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when using the energy balance method to determine changes in internal energy in cold snowpacks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We study how a stress perturbation generated by a mainshock affects a population of faults obeying a rate-state friction law. Depending on the model parameters and on the initial state, the fault exhibits aftershocks, slow earthquakes, or decaying afterslip. We found several regimes with slip rate decaying as a power-law of time, with different characteristic times and exponents. The complexity of the model makes it unrealistic to invert for the friction law parameters from afterslip data. We modeled afterslip measurements for the Southern California Superstition Hills earthquake using the complete rate-and-state law, and found a huge variety of model parameters that can fit the observed data. In particular, it is impossible to distinguish the stable velocity strengthening regime (A{\textgreater}B) from the (potentially) unstable velocity weakening regime (B{\textgreater}A and stiffness k{\textless}kc). Therefore, it is not necessary to involve small scale spatial or temporal fluctuations of friction parameters A or B in order to explain the transition between stable sliding and seismic slip. In addition to B/A and stiffness k/kc, the fault behavior is strongly controlled by stress levels following an event. Stress heterogeneity can thus explain most of the variety of postseismic behavior observed in nature. Afterslip will induce a progressive reloading of faults that are not slipping, which can trigger aftershocks. Using the relation between stress and seismicity derived from the rate-and-state friction law, we estimate the aftershock rate triggered by afterslip. Aftershock rate does not simply scale with stress rate, but exhibits a different characteristic time and power-law exponent.},

abstract = {Coverage of ice velocities in the central part of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, is obtained from feature tracking using repeat optical imagery in 2002 and 2006. Precise orthorectification, co-registration and correlation is carried out using the freely available software COSI-Corr. This analysis, combined with short times between image acquisitions, has enabled velocities to be captured even in the accumulation areas, where velocities are lowest and surface features ephemeral. The results indicate large velocities for mountain glaciers (i.e. up to 5md1) as well as dynamic changes in some glaciers that have occurred between 2002 and 2006. For the steep and more responsive Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers the speed increased at the glacier snout during the advance period, while the low-angled and debris-covered Tasman Glacier showed no measurable velocity change. Velocity increases on the steeper glaciers are the result of an observed thickening and steepening of the glacier tongues as they moved from a retreat phase in 2002 to an advance phase in 2006. This contrasting behaviour is consistent with historic terminus position changes. The steeper glaciers have undergone several advance/retreat cycles during the observation period (1894 to present), while the low-angled glacier showed little terminus response until retreat resulting from the accelerating growth of a proglacial lake commenced in 1983.},

In a plot of log B against reciprocal temperature , points scatter about a line defined by an empirical equation of the form B = B0 exp {\{} (To / T) - [ C / (Tr - • ] {\}} , where T is the temperature in kel - vins and Bo , C , To , Tr , and k are empirically determined constants . For laboratory data the scatter is equivalent to approximately a factor of 5 variation in strain rate for a given stress and temperature . The cause of this variation is unclear , but because results from any single laboratory are generally internally consistent , sample preparation procedures should be studied . Field experiments yield values of B that are systematically higher than laboratory results . Thus natural ice appears stronger than laboratory ice , de - spite the coarser texture and the presence of anisotropic fabrics in the natural ice , both of which should tend to soften it . In addition , natural ice in glaciers appears stronger than natural ice deformed in the laboratory . These observations suggest either that the stress is systematically overestimated in field stud - ies or that a flow law based on the von Mises yield criterion (or the second invariant of the stress deviator tensor) does not provide an adequate description of the deformation of ice in multiaxial stress fields .

@article{Howat2008,
abstract = {Current heuristic laws that relate the motion of glaciers due to sliding along the bed to the subglacial water pressure fail to reproduce variations in sliding speed on timescales of specific hydrologic events, such as lake drainage, rainfall, or surging. This may be due to the importance of subglacial cavity evolution and shifts in the glacier stress field, both of which are not accounted for in typical sliding laws. We use multiple time series of surface motion over a 66-day period at Breoamerkurjokull, Iceland, to infer changes in bed separation and longitudinal force budget. We observe multiple, distinct periods of increased surface motion and uplift corresponding to periods of rainfall and/or increased temperatures. We find consistent hysteresis and lags between motion and variations in both the bed separation and longitudinal stress gradient that we attribute to the redistribution of normal stresses at the bed during cavity growth. Increases in the longitudinal stress gradient suggest a downglacier stress transfer during increased basal motion that is consistent with increased drainage system efficiency toward the terminus. Our results suggest that the transient evolution of the subglacial drainage system and shifts in the glacier stress field are important controls on basal motion.},

abstract = {The size and shape of subglacial flow pathways exert a strong influence over the pressure and speed at which meltwaters are routed through glaciers. These characteristics, in turn, influence glacier sliding velocity and the quantity and quality of bulk meltwaters discharging from glaciers. In this paper we summarise four empirical research approaches that have been developed to improve our understanding of the subglacial hydrology of predominantly temperate-based, alpine glaciers: investigations of bulk meltwater discharge and chemistry; tracer studies; proglacial bedrock investigations, and borehole investigations. As a result of linking these studies to conceptual or numerical models, three arborescent and four non-arborescent, or distributed, subglacial drainage configurations are described. These drainage networks may be neither spatially nor temporally persistent, but may compete with, and replace, each other on a seasonal basis. A qualitative model of the temporal and spatial evolution of a typical alpine subglacial drainage system is advanced on the basis of research conducted at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland.},

We address the degree to which this difference may be attributed to the topographic asymmetry of the west-tilted Sierran block and the climate asymmetry resulting from orographic modification of Pacific Ocean storms. We simulate kilometer-scale glaciers within the 50 × 50 km Kings Canyon region of the southern Sierra by employing a two-dimensional numerical model that is driven by simple, spatially variable climates and treats ice transport by deformation, sliding, and avalanching. In numerical experiments, we match simulated termini to LGM moraine positions to constrain the parameters of different climate scenarios. The 38-km-long LGM glacier in Kings Canyon was reproduced by a climate specified by an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of 3170 m, a mass balance gradient of 0.01 m/yr/m, and a maximum positive balance of 2 m/yr.

abstract = {Two Monte Carlo-based approaches for assessing parameter uncertainty in complex hydrologic models are considered. The first, known as importance sampling, has been implemented in the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) framework of Beven and Binley. The second, known as the Metropolis algorithm, differs from importance sampling in that it uses a random walk that adapts to the true probability distribution describing parameter uncertainty. Three case studies are used to investigate and illustrate these Monte Carlo approaches. The first considers a simple water balance model for which exact results are known. It is shown that importance sampling is inferior to Metropolis sampling. Unless a large number of random samples are drawn, importance sampling can produce seriously misleading results. The second and third case studies consider more complex catchment models to illustrate the insights the Metropolis algorithm can offer. They demonstrate assessment of parameter uncertainty in the presence of bimodality, evaluation of the significance of split-sample tests, use of prior information and the assessment of confidence limits on hydrologic responses not used in calibration. When compared with the capabilities of traditional inference based on first-order approximation, the Metropolis algorithm provides a quantum advance in our capability to deal with parameter uncertainty in hydrologic models.},

The second and third case studies consider more complex catchment models to illustrate the insights the Metropolis algorithm can offer. They demonstrate assessment of parameter uncertainty in the presence of bimodality, evaluation of the significance of split-sample tests, use of prior information and the assessment of confidence limits on hydrologic responses not used in calibration. When compared with the capabilities of traditional inference based on first-order approximation, the Metropolis algorithm provides a quantum advance in our capability to deal with parameter uncertainty in hydrologic models.},

The truncated series solutions of the two infinite systems of simultaneous ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients are obtained for an arbitrary truncation order N. Each series solution together with logarithmic terms is shown to be convergent in the entire physical interval of interest. By the construction of the complete solutions of the systems, the corresponding hydrodynamical problem formulated in terms of the stream function has been solved. As a specimen numerical application, the drag on a prolate spheroid is computed and compared with the exact one.

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present the validation over Greenland of a thermodynamic snow-ice model that was complemented with the snow metamorphism and albedo parameterizations of the Centre d'Etudes de la Neige (Grenoble, France) in order to make the surface albedo variable and interactive. Special attention is given to the surface albedo since it is the most important parameter in energy exchanges with the atmosphere for snow and ice melt. The development of an integrated (snow, ice, and water) albedo model takes into account the different surface types observed on an ice sheet, and the snow albedo is calculated from the simulated surface snow grains. The validation for a polar site has been done at ETH Camp (West Greenland, 1155 m above sea level) during the 1990 and 1991 summer seasons. Although both ablation seasons differed greatly (in 1990 it showed a negative mass balance while in 1991 it ended with a positive mass balance), a single model configuration was able to provide good results for both 1990 and 1991. These simulations show that the snow metamorphism laws included enable an accurate simulation of the surface albedo and henceforth of the surface mass balance for a polar site, provided that the snow model is correctly forced at its surface level and that meltwater retention, percolation, and drainage are well represented in the snow model. The model results are also compared with two other modeling approaches, and differences between the three snow models are detailed.},

Although fracture toughness showed no sensitivity to temperature, we find that tensile strength increases with decreasing temperature at 7 kPa K−1for all ice types tested.

Samples tested submerged in liquid ethanol were 0.45 MPa weaker than in air; increasing porosity reduced tensile strength. Tensile strength increased linearly with concentration of urea, basalt and ammonium sulfate. These results suggest that on Titan and other icy satellites, the tensile strength of fine-grained polycrystalline water ice containing solid impurities may be several times greater than the 1 MPa value commonly used in modeling. For low strain rate processes where fracture propagation rather than fracture initiation limits strength, a temperature invariant fracture toughness of 0.15 MPa m1/2 is appropriate.

@article{Luckman2012,
abstract = {Basal crevasses extend upwards from the base of ice bodies and can penetrate more than halfway through the ice column under conditions found commonly on ice shelves. As a result, they may locally modify the exchange of mass and energy between ice shelf and ocean, and by altering the shelf's mechanical properties could play a fundamental role in ice shelf stability. Although early studies revealed that such features may be abundant on Antarctic ice shelves, their geometrical properties and spatial distribution has gained little attention. We investigate basal crevasses in Larsen C Ice Shelf using field radar survey, remote sensing and numerical modelling. We demonstrate that a group of features visible in MODIS imagery are the surface expressions of basal crevasses in the form of surface troughs, and find that basal crevasses can be generated as a result of stresses well downstream of the grounding line. We show that linear elastic fracture mechanics modelling is a good predictor of basal crevasse penetration height where stresses are predominantly tensile, and that measured surface trough depth does not always reflect this height, probably because of snow accumulation in the trough, marine ice accretion in the crevasse, or stress bridging from the surrounding ice. We conclude that all features visible in MODIS imagery of ice shelves and previously labelled simply as "crevasses", where they are not full thickness rifts, must be basal crevasse troughs, highlighting a fundamental structural property of many ice shelves that may have been previously overlooked.},

The spatial distribution of radar based snow depth allows a clear distinction of three zones of different accumulation characteristics: 1) The lower part of Findel Glacier shows a clear altitudinal trend while 2) the upper part has no trend in altitude but high spatial fluctuations in snow depth. 3) Adler Glacier's accumulation characteristics are similar to zone 2). However, despite their close vicinity, accumulation on 3) is reduced by 40{\%} compared to 2). The observed strong spatial variability emphasises the need for spatially continuous measurements for studies involving accumulation on glaciers. Finally, reasons for observed variations e. g., preferential snow deposition and snow redistribution) are discussed.},

abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

abstract = {[1] Crevasses form in response to tensile stresses in glaciers and ice sheets. It has been widely assumed that crevasses initiate at, or near, the surface of the ice, from starter cracks up to a few centimeters long. If the tensile stress is sufficient, these cracks propagate downward into the ice to form a crevasse, until the weight-induced lithostatic stress prevents them penetrating deeper. We present ground-penetrating radar data acquired on the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, which indicate that crevasses occur at depths of several meters beneath the ice surface and were formed in areas where surface crevassing is absent. The data support the hypothesis that these are examples of subsurface crevasse formation. Using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), we investigate the feasibility of crevasse initiation at depth. We consider the initiation of an isolated crevasse from a subsurface crack, subject to a "dynamic tensile stress'' which results from deformation associated with ice movement and a weight-induced lithostatic stress. The LEFM approach allows us to estimate a(init), the minimum length a crack must be before crack propagation will occur. In earlier models of crevasse formation, it was assumed that the dynamic tensile stress is constant with depth. We consider a more realistic scenario, where the dynamic tensile stress varies with depth, in such a way that the tensile strain rate remains constant. We show that in this scenario, crevasse initiation from centimeter-scale starter cracks is feasible at depths of 10-30 m, as well as at the surface. At present, the formulation of a reliable predictive model is limited by an incomplete knowledge of the mechanical properties of firn. In previous studies, the depth of buried crevasses has been used to estimate the time elapsed since ice was exposed to higher stresses and different flow regimes. In the light of the results presented here, those estimates may need to be reviewed.},

abstract = {We present results from numerical ice-flow models that include calving criteria based on penetration of surface and basal crevasses, which in turn is a function of longitudinal strain rates near the glacier front. The position of the calving front is defined as the point where either (1) surface crevasses reach the waterline (model CDw), or (2) surface and basal crevasses penetrate the full
thickness of the glacier (model CD). For comparison with previous studies, results are also presented for
a height-above-buoyancy calving model. Qualitatively, both models CDw and CD produce similar behaviour. Unlike previous models for calving, the new calving criteria are applicable to both grounded termini and floating ice shelves and tongues. The numerical ice-flow model is applied to an idealized geometry characteristic of marine outlet glaciers. Results indicate that grounding-line dynamics are less sensitive to basal topography than previously suggested. Stable grounding-line positions can be obtained even on a reverse bed slope with or without floating termini. The proposed calving criteria also allow
calving losses to be linked to surface melt and therefore climate. In contrast to previous studies in which
calving rate or position of the terminus is linked to local water depth, the new calving criterion is able to
produce seasonal cycles of retreat and advance as observed for Greenland marine outlet glaciers. The
contrasting dynamical behaviour and stability found for different calving models suggests that a realistic
parameterization for the process of calving is crucial for any predictions of marine outlet glacier change.},

abstract = {Dye tracing techniques were used to investigate the glacier-wide pattern of change in the englacial/subglacial drainage system of Haut Glacier d'Arolla during the ablation seasons of 1990 and 1991. Analysis of breakthrough curve characteristics indicate that over the course of a melt season, a system of major channels developed by headward growth at the expense of a hydraulically inefficient distributed system. By the end of the melt season, this channel system extended at least 3.3 km from the snout of the 4 km long glacier and drained the bulk of supraglacially derived meltwater passing through the glacier. The upper limit of the channel system closely followed the retreating snowline up-glacier. Rates of headward channel growth reached c. 65 md(-1), although these rates decreased in the upper 1 km of the glacier where snowline retreat exposed a patchy firn aquifer. It appears that the removal of snow (with its high albedo and significant water storage capacity) from the glacier surface resulted in a dramatic increase in the volume of runoff into moulins, and in the peakedness of daily runoff cycles. This induced transient high water pressures within the distributed drainage system, which caused it to evolve rapidly into a channelised system. It is therefore likely that, at a local scale, channel growth occurred down-glacier from moulins, and that the overall up-glacier-directed pattern of channel formation was caused by the retreating snowline exposing new moulins and crevasses to inputs of ice-derived meltwater. Damping of diurnal melt inputs by storage in the firn aquifer accounts for the slowing of channel growth in the upper glacier. (C) 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The flow of valley glaciers is examined in the light of recent laboratory experiments on the behaviour of ice under load. Simple expressions are given for the velocity distributions in some cases of laminar flow, and the modification of a pure laminar flow theory necessary to explain the formation of transverse crevasses and thrust planes is considered. The paper ends with some remarks about the formation of crevasse patterns on the surfaces of glaciers. The statical equilibrium of a circular ice cap is discussed in an appendix. RESUME. L'ecoulement des glaciers dans les vallees est examine a la lumiere des experiences recentes en labora­ toire sur le comportement de la glace soumise a une compression. Des expressions simples sont donnees pour la distribution des vitesses dans quelques cas de courants laminaires. On considere ensuite les modifications a apporter a une theorie sur les courants purement laminaires pour expliquer la formation des crevasses transversales et des plans de glissement. Cette communication se termine pa� quelques remarques concernant les figures formees par les crevasses sur la surface des glaciers. L'equilibre d'une calotte circulaire de glace est discute dans un Appendice. I. THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ICE Present knowledge of the mechanical properties of ice suggests a re-examination of the theory of the flow of long valley glaciers. It has sometimes been assumed that ice under stress behaves like a very viscous Newtonian liquid: in other words, that for ice, as for a liquid, there is a proportional relationship between rate of strain (velocity gradient) y and shear stress T, as shown by curve B in Fig. I (p. 83), a.lthough the coefficient of viscosity for ice is much greater than for a normal liquid.'*' Unfortunately, this assumption, although mathematically simple, does not represent the real behaviour of ice very well. A constant viscosity is not observed with other polycrystalline materials such as metals, and it would be surprising if ice were an exception. In fact the matter seems now to have been put beyond doubt by careful laboratory experiments carried out by Mr. J. W. Glen.ll He finds that, just as with a metal, applying a sustained constant stress (he actually applies a uniaxial compressive stress) to a specimen of ice causes it to deform permanently, and that after a few hours (the "transient" period) the rate of deformation settles down to a steady value. If the experiment is repeated with different values of the stress, the relationship between shear stress T and the rate of shear strain y in the specimen is given by a curve of the general shape shown at A in Fig.!. At low shear stresses the rate of strain is small; for higher shear stresses, however, the rate increases very rapidly, so that a small increase of stress produces a large increase in strain­ rate. This is the type of curve, then, on which a theory of glacier motion should be based. In a glacier the state of stress is not uniaxial, as in Glen's experiments, but triaxial, and in particular there is a hydrostatic pressure acting deep in the ice. The pressure reaches about 30 atmospheres in the Mer de Glace and 300 atmospheres or more in the Greenland ice cap. It has been suggested by Streiff-Becker, by Haefeli and by Demorest that this pressure may make the ice more deformable at depth, that is, reduce the shear stress needed to produce a given rate of strain. There seems to be no direct experimental evidence on the behaviour under shear stress of ice or any other polycrystalline substance already subjected to a high pressure and very near the melting point, and I think one should keep an open mind on what might occur. It may be remarked, how­ ever: that a pressure effect is not observed in metals far from the melting point, and that with liquids the viscosity is substantially independent of pressure. The present discussion is founded on the assumption that any pressure effect is negligible in ice. Should the existence of such an effect be later proved by experiment the necessary modifications of the expressions in Section 2 would be simple; the changes that would occur in the results of Section 3 are not so obvious.

(2) Such ice, in shear parallel to the ice-sheet bed, develops a strong, near-vertical, single-maximum fabric. (3) This fabric favours further deformation and this, in turn, further strengthens the fabric and keeps the crystals small. (4) This is why the strain rate in ice-age ice, in simple shear, is some 2.5 times that in Holocene ice at the same stress and temperature. (5) Ice-age ice under other stress systems, such as ice in roughly the upper 60{\%} of the ice thickness, in bedrock hollows, at a stationary ice divide, in ice streams and in ice shelves, will not have enhanced flow.

abstract = {Wet slab and glide snow avalanches are dangerous and yet can be particularly difficult to predict. Wet slab and glide avalanches are presumably triggered by free water moving through the snowpack and the subsequent interaction with layer or ground interfaces, and typically occur in the spring during warming and subsequent melt periods. In Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana, both types of avalanches can occur in the same year and affect the spring opening operations of the Going-to-the-Sun Road (GTSR).We investigated the timing of wet slab and glide avalanche occurrence along the GTSR from 2003 to 2011 using meteorological and snowpack data from two high-elevation weather stations, one SNOTEL site, and an avalanche database to characterize 55 wet slab and 182 glide avalanches. Daily wet slab and glide avalanche occurrence were combined to represent an avalanche day and were compared to non-avalanche days (no avalanche occurrence) for 60 variables (both direct and derived measurements) using a univariate analysis. A classification tree (CART) was then trained to capture the most important variables for examining specific meteorological and snowpack variables that contribute to these types of wet snow avalanches. The CART was 10-fold cross validated using the data for 2003-2010 seasons and resulted in overall predictive accuracy of 73{\%}. We then used the statistically optimal CART as a predictive model for the spring avalanche season of 2011, which resulted in an overall predictive accuracy of 82{\%} for both avalanche and non-avalanche days, and a predictive accuracy of 91{\%} for avalanche days.The results suggest that the role of air temperature and snowpack settlement appear to be the most important variables in wet slab and glide avalanche occurrence. When applied to the 2011 season, the results of the CART model are encouraging and they enhance our understanding of some of the required meteorological and snowpack conditions for wet slab and glide avalanche occurrence. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {An understanding of the reflection and transmission of light by snow is important for snow thermodynamics, hydrology, ecology and remote sensing. Snow has an intricate microstructure replete with ice/air interfaces that scatter light. Spectral observations of light reflection and transmission, from 400 to 1000 nm, were made in temperate snowpacks, under cold and under melting conditions. The optical observations were made using a dual-detector spectroradiometer. One detector was placed above the snow surface to monitor the incident and reflected solar irradiance, and the second detector was placed at the base of snow cover to measure downwelling irradiance. The optical measurements were supplemented by a physical characterization of the snow, including depth, density and an estimate of grain size. In general, transmitted light levels were low and showed a strong spectral dependence, with maximum values between 450 and 550 nm. For example, a 10 cm thick snow layer reduced visible transmission (500 nm) to about 5{\%} of the incident irradiance, and infrared transmission (800 nm) to less than 1{\%}. Extinction coefficients were in the range 3-30 m(-1), and tended to decrease slightly as the snow aged and increase as snow density increased.},

abstract = {Cryo␣Hydrologic (CH) warming is proposed as a potential mechanism for rapid thermal response of glaciers and ice sheets to climate warming. We present a simple parameterization to incorporate CH warming in thermal models of ice sheets using a dual␣continuum concept, which treats ice and the cryo-hydrologic system (CHS) as overlapping continua with heat exchange between them. The presence of liquid water in the CHS due to surface melt leads to warming of the ice. The magnitude and time␣scale of CH warming is controlled by the average spacing between elements of the CHS, which is often of the order of just 10's of meters. The corresponding time␣scale of thermal response is of the order of years␣decades, in contrast to conventional estimates of thermal response time␣scales based on vertical conduction through ice (␣102–3 m thick), which are of the order of centuries to millennia. We show that CH warming is already occurring along the west coast of Greenland. Increased temperatures resulting from CH warming will reduce ice viscosity and thus contribute to faster ice flow.},

Damage is modeled by a sym-metric second rank tensor that structurally plays the role of an internal variable. It may be interpreted as a texture measure that quantifies the effective specific areas over which internal stresses can be transmit-ted. The evolution equation for the damage tensor is motivated in the reference configuration and pushed forward to the present configuration. A spatially objective constitutive form of the evolution equation for the damage tensor is obtained. The rheology of the damaged ice presumes no volume conservation. Its constitutive relations are derived from the free enthalpy and a dissipation potential, and extends the classical isotropic power law by elastic and damage tensor dependent terms. All constitutive relations are in conformity with the second law of thermodynamics.},

abstract = {In 1972 and 1995, shallow ice temperatures were measured at identical locations and depths on polythermal McCall Glacier, Brooks Range, Alaska, U.S.A. Mean annual ice temperatures at 10 m depth (T ) have systematically increased by 10 R1K for the ablation area (1400{\^{}}1900 m), while closer to the firn area, where meltwater percolation and refreezing play a role, they remained approximately unchanged. Inter- preting these findings in terms of climate change requires careful consideration of the observed thinning of the glacier, which causes lowering of the surface through an existing vertical temperature gradient. Such temperature gradients can be particularly large in the ablation areas of polythermal glaciers; on McCall Glacier they are on the order of 0.2 K m{\^{}}1. We also study the evolution of a 75 m deep temperature profile measured at one location in 1972 using a one-dimensional heat-diffusion model. We find that this profile was in approximate equilibrium with the mean surface temperature extrapolated from the 1972 data. Using the observed rate of surface lowering and measured rates of vertical advection, we find that both the measured temperature change and the vertical temperature gradient at 10 m depth can be reproduced only if the mean annual surface temperature on McCall Glacier has increased by 1.1 ±0.3 K between 1972 and 1995. This result is consistent with the observed trend toward more negative mass balances on the glacier in the 1990s.},

abstract = {In the past, several empirical firn-densification models have been developed fitted to measured density{\&}{\#}8211;depth profiles from Greenland and Antarctica. These models do not specifically deal with refreezing of meltwater in the firn. Ice lenses are usually indirectly taken into account by choosing a suitable value of the surface snow density. In the present study, a simple densification model is developed that specifically accounts for the content of ice lenses in the snowpack. An annual layer is considered to be composed of an ice fraction and a firn fraction. It is assumed that all meltwater formed at the surface in one year will refreeze in the corresponding annual layer, and that no additional melting or refreezing occurs in deeper layers. With this assumption, further densification is solely controlled by compaction of the firn fraction of the annual layer. Comparison of modelled and observed depth{\&}{\#}8211;density profiles from Canadian Arctic ice-core sites with large melting{\&}{\#}8211;refreezing percentages shows good agreement. The model is also used to estimate the long-term surface elevation change in interior Greenland that will result from temperature-driven changes of density{\&}{\#}8211;depth profiles. These surface elevation changes reflect a volume change of the ice sheet with no corresponding change of mass, i.e. a volume change that does not influence global sea level.},

abstract = {Recent disintegration of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula has highlighted the need for a better understanding of ice shelf fracture processes generally. In this paper we present a fracture criterion, incorporating new experimental fracture data, coupled with an ice shelf flow model to predict the spatial distribution of surface crevassing on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. We have developed experiments that have enabled us to quantify, for the first time, quasi-stable crack growth in Antarctic ice core specimens using a fracture initiation toughness, K-init, for which crack growth commences. The tests cover a full range of nearsurface densities, rho = 560-871 kg m(-3) (10.9-75.7 m depth). Results indicate an apparently linear dependence of fracture toughness on porosity such that K-int = 0.257 rho-80.7, predicting a zero-porosity toughness of K-o = 155 kPa m(1/2). We have used this data to test the applicability to crevassing of a two-dimensional fracture mechanics criterion for the propagation of a small sharp crack in a biaxial stress field. The growth of an initial flaw into a larger crevasse, which involves a purely tensile crack opening, depends on the size of the flaw, the magnitude of K-init, and the nature of the applied stress field. By incorporating the criterion into a stress map of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf derived from a depth-integrated finite element model of the strain-rate field, we have been able to predict regions of potential crevassing. These agree well with satellite imagery provided an initial flaw size is assumed in the range 5-50 cm.},

His achievements on this subject are related to the broader context of his interest in transport phenomena, particularly liquid-gas phase changes and chemical reactions in the years 1873 and 1889 respectively. Stefan's eponymous work is placed in perspective between the present and the first experimental and analytical attempts to describe the solid-liquid phase change by the pioneers Blake in the 17th, and Lam??, Clapeyron and Neumann in the 18th century. In honour of Stefan's work involving moving and free boundaries, the concepts of the Stefan problem and the Stefan number are widely used nowadays. The primary intention of this paper is to attempt to complete and unify the information on the historical roots which led to these two terms. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {We present a numerical method which computes the motion of complex solid/liquid boundaries in crystal growth. The model we solve includes physical effects such as crystalline anisotropy, surface tension, molecular kinetics, and undercooling. The method is based on two ideas. First, the equations of motion are recast as a single history-dependent boundary integral equation on the solid/liquid boundary. A fast algorithm is used to solve the integral equation efficiently. Second, the boundary is moved by solving a "Hamilton-Jacobi" -type equation (on a fixed domain) formulated by Osher and Sethian for a function in which the boundary is a particular level set. This equation is solved by finite difference schemes borrowed from the technology of hyperbolic conservation laws. The two ideas are combined by constructing a smooth extension of the normal velocity off the moving boundary, in a way suggested by the physics of the problem. Our numerical experiments show the evolution of complex crystalline shapes, development of large spikes and corners, dendrite formation and side-branching, and pieces of solid merging and breaking off freely. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Black Rapids Glacier is a 40 km long surge-type glacier in the central Alaska Range. In spring 1997 a wireline drill rig was set up at a location where the measured surface velocities are high and seasonal and annual velocity variations are large. The drilling-revealed a layer of subglacial "till" up to 7 m thick, that is believed to be water-saturated. At one location a string of instruments, containing three dual-axis tiltmeters and one piezometer, was successfully introduced into the till. The tiltmeters monitored the inclination of the borehole at the ice-till interface and at 1 and 2 m into the till, for 410 days. They showed that no significant deformation occurred in the upper 2 m of the till layer, and no significant amount of the basal motion was due to sliding of the ice over the till. The measured surface velocity at the drill site is about 60 m a(-1), of which 20-30 m a(-1) can be accounted for by ice deformation. Almost the entire amount of basal motion, 30-40 m a(-1), was taken up at a depth of {\textgreater} 2 m in the till, possibly in discrete shear layers, or as sliding of till over the underlying bedrock. We propose that the large-scale mobilization of such till layers is a key factor in initiating glacier surges.},

@article{Weiss2004,
abstract = {Recent investigations of crevassing on alpine glaciers and ice shelves have been based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). However, LEFM is unable to explain some aspects of crevasse formation such as the initiation of crevasse propagation from crystal-scale (mm) microcracks, the slow propagation of large fractures in ice shelves, and the acceleration of crevasse opening before breaking of the ice terminus. Here another mechanism to account for these observations is proposed: subcritical crevassing. Subcritical crack growth, documented in many materials though not yet explored in ice, is characterized by a crack velocity that scales as a power of the tensile stress intensity factor, but is much less than that associated with critical crack propagation. This mechanism allows crevasse propagation from mm-scale microcracks at velocities much lower than body wave speeds, and explains crevasse-opening accelerations in a natural way. Subcritical crevassing is theoretically explored for several simplified situations but is limited by a lack of available data on crevasse evolution.},

abstract = {The heat energy fluxes at an ice surface in the Antarctic coastal ablation zone were measured close to the A. N. A. R. E. station Mavvson and a Fourier analysis was carried out on the monthly mean values of all components. The energy transfer in the ice was measured and analysed by computing the amplitudes of the radiative and conductive heat fluxes at various depths in the ice. In the surface heat budget the eddy heat transfer to the surface is the largest budget component with an annual mean value of 60 cal cm" 2 day" 1 and an annual amplitude of 50 cal cm{\~{}}' 2 day" 1 balancing the annual mean heat energy loss of 22 cal cm"" 2 day" 1 by radiation and 38 cal cm" 2 day" 1 by evaporation and melting at the ice surface. The annual amplitude of the conducted heat flux through the surface of the ice resulting from changes in the net heat storage is approximately 30 cal cm" 2 day"* 1 and one third of the amplitude of the radiative net short wave flux through the surface. The annual temperature wave at the surface and the absorbed radiation contribute about equally to net changes in stored heat. At four metres depth the amplitude of the radiative flux is one third of that of the conductive flux and the contribution of absorbed radiation to net changes in stored heat is still 15 per cent. The mean annual value of the absorbed short wave radiation is 90 cal cm" 2 day" 1 and heat losses by conduction due to the presence of a mean annual temperature gradient in the ice have equal magnitude but apposite sign to give zero annual net heat storage in the ice. Finally a comparison is carried out of the Mawson results with five other Antarctic heat budget studies in different wind regions and over ice and snow of varying optical and thermal properties.

abstract = {Data assimilation is the process by which observational data are fused with scientific information. The Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent probabilistic approach for combining information, and thus is an appropriate framework for data assimilation. Viewing data assimilation as a problem in Bayesian statistics is not new. However, the field of Bayesian statistics is rapidly evolving and new approaches for model construction and sampling have been utilized recently in a wide variety of disciplines to combine information. This article includes a brief introduction to Bayesian methods. Paying particular attention to data assimilation, we review linkages to optimal interpolation, kriging, Kalman filtering, smoothing, and variational analysis. Discussion is provided concerning Monte Carlo methods for implementing Bayesian analysis, including importance sampling, particle filtering, ensemble Kalman filtering, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Finally, hierarchical Bayesian modeling is reviewed. We indicate how this approach can be used to incorporate significant physically based prior information into statistical models, thereby accounting for uncertainty. The approach is illustrated in a simplified advection-diffusion model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this work some principles of viscoelastic theory as applicable to ice are reviewed. A muitiaxial ice model, incorporating nonlinear damage, is presented based on the Burgers viscoelastic body with nonlinear dashpots in both the Kelvin and the Maxwell units. This mechanical ice model is found to be very efficient and accurate, especially for short loading periods. It includes the effects of microcracks and damage on the reduction in elastic modulus and the enhancement in creep deformation. Damage evolution is based on Schapery's approach using the generalized J integral theory. Volumetric deformation under compression is included which is mostly dilatation due to microcracking and other microstructural changes. Triaxial tests on laboratory-produced granular ice have been conducted to investigate the deformation of ice and the influence of cracks and damage. These tests have also been used to verify and calibrate the constitutive modelling. The damage model has been developed in FORTRAN code and implemented as a user subroutine in the ABAQUS finite element analysis program. The theoretical model provides good agreement with test results.},

abstract = {Subglacial stick-slip motion speeds erosion by hydrofracturing and in other ways, as determined from analysis of the growing body of field data. Microearthquake monitoring commonly detects subglacial earthquakes, likely mostly from stick-slip motion of debris-laden ice over bedrock. Source parameters show that many quakes cause enough motion to greatly lower water pressure in cavities on the lee sides of bedrock steps. We calculate that the resulting expansion of higher-pressure water in nearby cracks promotes hydrofracturing, with even relatively small cracks growing unstably under thick glaciers and all cracks growing faster than for aseismic behavior. This mechanism also helps generate the step-like topography favoring block plucking. This stick-slip glacier-erosion hypothesis suggests that the erosion rate will increase with ice thickness as well as basal shear stress, ice-flow velocity, and water supply.},
